# Battery Performance EDA

## Overview
This repository contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and insights derived from battery performance data, focusing on lithium-ion battery life prediction. The goal is to analyze the dataset, visualize trends, and build a foundation for predictive modeling.

## Project Structure


## Data
Data was taken from `https://data.matr.io/1/` , a portal for data used in [Severson et al] (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-019-0356-8).


## Motivation

- Data generation with data-driven modelling to predict the behaviour of complex systems far into the future.
- advantage of focusing on voltage-capacity data is that this data “comes for free ” in a typical battery cycling experiment.
