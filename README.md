# Battery_DS
Data was taken from `https://data.matr.io/1/` , a portal for data used in [Severson et al] (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-019-0356-8).


## Motivation

- Data generation with data-driven modelling to predict the behaviour of complex systems far into the future.
- advantage of focusing on voltage-capacity data is that this data “comes for free ” in a typical battery cycling experiment.
